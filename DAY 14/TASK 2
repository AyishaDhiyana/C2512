Problem Statement: `Employee Salary Management System`

`Objective`:  
You need to develop a C++ program that performs the following tasks:

1. `Input an Array of Salaries`:
   - The program should take input for the salaries of `10 employees` 
   (you can modify the number as required).
   - The program should store these salaries in an array.

2. `Find the Second Highest Salary`:
   - Implement a function to find the second highest salary in the array.

3. `Check if the Second Highest Salary is Exactly 5 Digits`:
   - After identifying the second highest salary, 
   check whether the salary is a 5-digit number (between 10000 and 99999).
   - Print a message indicating 
   whether the second highest salary is 5 digits or not.

4. `Print All Salaries`:
   - Implement a function 
   to print all employee salaries stored in the array.
